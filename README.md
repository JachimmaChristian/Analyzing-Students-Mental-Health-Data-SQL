# Project-Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health-in-SQL

This project analyzes a dataset of international students at a Japanese university to uncover relationships between mental health, social connectedness, acculturative stress, and length of stay.

**Key questions investigated:**

1. Do international students experience higher rates of mental health challenges compared to the general population?
2. What factors contribute to or mitigate these challenges?
3. Does length of stay in a new country impact mental health outcomes?

**Technologies used:**

PostgreSQL (for data cleaning, analysis, and querying)

**Key findings:**

1. International students reported higher average depression scores.
2. Social connectedness was a significant predictor of lower depression scores.
3. Acculturative stress was associated with higher depression scores.
4. Length of stay did not show a clear linear relationship with depression scores.

**Implications:**

Results underscore the importance of supporting international students' mental health.
Universities can implement resources and programs to foster social connections, manage stress, and promote cultural adjustment.

**Data source:**

2018 study of international students at a Japanese university (cite original study)

**Future directions:**

Explore additional factors influencing international student mental health.
Develop and evaluate interventions to promote wellbeing and reduce stress.
Conduct longitudinal studies to track mental health trajectories over time.
